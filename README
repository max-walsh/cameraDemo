This app was created to demonstrate the use of the camera functionality within iOS. It focuses on using the UIImagePickerController class to utilize the native user interface for the camera.

This app must be run on an actual iOS device to fully test its features. Running the app on a simulator will result in an alert message when trying to access the camera.
